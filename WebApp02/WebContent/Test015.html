	<p>Anchor: As former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden emerged as the next American president over the weekend, Seoul started to communicate with his transition camp. As South Korea is concerned that Biden might undo the current nuclear talks with North Korea, former U.S. ambassadors to Seoul told KBS World Radio that a more traditional approach to North Korea might yield a better result in the current stalemate.

"Hello, my fellow Americans! Folks, the people of this nation have spoken. They’ve delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory, a victory for we, the people."

On the day Joe Biden declared his election as the next president of the United States, South Korea sent Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha to Washington.

"I sought this office to restore the soul of America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class, and to make America respected around the world again... "
"Tonight, the whole world is watching America, and I believe, at our best, America is a beacon for the globe. We will lead not only by the example of our power, but by the power of our example."

With Biden's transition committee signaling plans to reverse Trump's key foreign and domestic policies, Seoul is concerned that it could lead to changes in the U.S. approach to North Korea. 

Speaking to South Korean reporters in Washington on Sunday, Kang acknowledged that she will be meeting officials from the Biden camp.

"I do not think that they are reverting to the strategic patience approach, judging from what various figures on Biden’s side have openly said. We believe that progress should be made based on various achievements from the last three years." 

In an interview with KBS World Radio before Biden's election, former U.S. Ambassadors, Dr. Robert Gallucci and Kathleen Stephens, predicted that Biden will take a more traditional approach in dealing with North Korea, and that Seoul might prefer that change.</p>
